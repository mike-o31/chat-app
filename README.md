# Chat-app

Created the Chat app to gain experience in real-time communication. Utilized Socket.io for user-to-user communication and to better understand how websockets work and created a backend server with Express.js. Used MongoDB as the database where all chat messages are stored, practicing querying the database and returning filtered queries. For the entire project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js/Express.js, and MongoDB.
